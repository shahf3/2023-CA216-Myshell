# introduction
The shell is a command-line interface that allows you to interact with your computer's operating system. This manual will provide a basic overview of how to use the shell, including i/o redirection, the program environment, and background program execution.
# command lists and brief description
this shell contains some of the basic commands that one can use in linux;cd, clr, dir, environ, echo, help, pause, quit.

To use a command, simply type the command followed by any arguments, and press Enter.

cd: Change the current directory, clr: Clear the screen, dir or ls: List the contents of a directory, environ: List all the environment variables, echo: Print a message to the screen, help: Display the user manual, pause: Pause the shell operation, quit: Quit the shell

i/o redirection allows you to redirect the standard input or output of a command to a file or device.

To redirect standard output, you can use the > symbol followed by the name of the file. This will redirect the output of the dir command to a file named "any_name".txt.

To redirect standard input, you can use the < symbol followed by the name of the file.

The shell maintains a PROGRAM ENVIRONMENT that contains information about the current shell session. This environment includes variables, aliases, and functions.To view the environment variables, you can use the environ command.
